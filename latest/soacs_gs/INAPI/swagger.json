                "description":"Allows raw business events to be sent to a Real-Time Integration Business Insight server for processing. Insight accepts events via the REST API for all milestones where API invocations are enabled. Events are parsed and associated with the appropriate instances, based on correlated IDs. <br><br> When you send an event for an initial milestone, you include a <code>identifierValue</code> value in the payload, containing that instance's unique identifier, such as an order number or a service request ticket number. You send the same value as the <code>correlationValue</code>. Insight uses the <code>correlationValue</code> to correlate events that belong to the same instance, such as the same order. You can view events corresponding to each instance in the Insight console. Note that events sent with a <code>correlationValue</code> that does not match a received <code>identifierValue</code> are not processed and will not appear in the console. <br><br> Download the API manifest to view JSON payload templates for all the milestones added for your model. The template for each milestone contains the <code>milestoneId</code> and <code>modelId</code> required to be sent for business events for each milestone.
